## Starting 2024 injured

In November of 2023 I was in a bicycle accident and broke my shoulder in two places. Recovery was complicated by not being instructed by the physio what could happen if I didn't follow through on exercises. Turns out when you hit your middle years certain conditions can cause [frozen shoulder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive_capsulitis_of_the_shoulder). In my case those conditions are:

- Inactivity and following through on the right exercises from not being told what could happen. I lifted weights, but didn't do the right movements
- A genetic pre-disposition on both parent's side toward diabeties
- While Capoeira and BJJ are things I do, I'm in my fifties.

So the frozen shoulder got really bad. For the first few months of the year the pain was very intense. I got better thanks to a mix of Acupuncture, Tai Chi, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.
