## Selecting a school

- Distance to home or work
- Schedule
- Coach is accommodating

## Getting in shape to start at BJJ

- Don't bother, it will get you in shape
- If already in shape, expect to be wiped

## First class

- Go in humble, have good manners
- Introduce yourself by name to new partners


##Â Cognitive Overload

- BJJ is a deep art with a lot of stuff going on. At first, everyone is confused and overwhelmed
