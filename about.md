# About Me

I am a [coder](https://github.com/pydanny), [author](/books), and [speaker](/speaking).

I'm probably best known as "[pydanny](https://www.google.com/search?q=pydanny)", one of the authors of [Two Scoops of Django](/books/tech). 

I love to hang out with my [wife](https://audrey.feldroy.com/), play with my [daughter](/tags/uma), do [Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu) at [Apex BJJ](https://www.apexbjj.co.uk/) in London, write [books](/books), and read books. I work at [Kraken Tech](https://kraken.tech/), a company that is part of the sustainable global energy  [Octopus Energy Group](https://octopusenergy.group/) working to address [global climate change](/tags/climate-change).

## About this site

This site is written mostly using NextJS. This is my first React project, which I learned in May 2021 to build out [Octopus Energy US](https://octopusenergy.com). There are a number of Python scripts that support it.

The source code is on [github](https://github.com/pydanny/daniel.feldroy.com).

## What about pydanny.com?

That site redirects here. The reason for that is while I'm a huge fan of the Python programming language, there are other languages that I like just as much. To be forever tied to one language felt limiting, hence why I moved the site to daniel.feldroy.com and stopped using "pydanny" so much.
